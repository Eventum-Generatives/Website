# Files and locations

## File types 

There are five basic types of file in Eventum:
1. **Configuration file** - main configuration file which was reviewed in previous page, we specify it as an argument when starting Eventum
2. **Sample file** - CSV sample used by Jinja event plugin to enrich events with specific data
3. **Template file** - jinja template used by Jinja event plugin as well, it is used to define structure of events
4. **Time pattern file** - yaml file used by Time patterns input plugin, it contains time distribution parameters
5. **Compose file** - yaml file for [`eventum-compose`](../compose/) tool to run multiple generators at once

## Resolving paths

Paths of all listed above can be absolute or relative. If relative path is provided and file is not found from current working directory then Eventum will search it in the default directory of content which is `$HOME/.eventum/content/<content type>/`. When you are working with Eventum Studio and save some file it is always saved there.

It is recommended (*for convenience purposes*) to keep all of Eventum files in this directory, thus your content can be accessed by different Eventum components in centralized way.

## Log files

When you start Eventum with some configuration it creates log file named `generator-<config name>.log` in `$HOME/.eventum/logs/`. In case of usage `eventum-compose`, all generators listed in compose file will write logs in `compose-<compose config name>.log`.
